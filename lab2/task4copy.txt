Â€¦ THE SECRET SIDE OF ME
I NEVER LET YOU SEE
I KEEP IT CAGED, BUT I CAN'T CONTROL IT
SO STAY AWAY FROM ME
THE BEAST IS UGLY
I FEEL THE RAGE, AND I JUST CAN'T HOLD IT
IT'S SCRATCHING ON THE WALLS
IN THE CLOSET, IN THE HALLS
IT COMES AWAKE, AND I CAN'T CONTROL IT
HIDING UNDER THE BED
IN MY BODY, IN MY HEAD
WHY WON'T SOMEBODY COME AND SAVE ME FROM THIS?
MAKE IT END
Â€¦ I FEEL IT DEEP WITHIN
IT'S JUST BENEATH THE SKIN
I MUST CONFESS THAT I FEEL LIKE A MONSTER
I HATE WHAT I'VE BECOME
THE NIGHTMARE'S JUST BEGUN
I MUST CONFESS THAT I FEEL LIKE A MONSTER
I, I FEEL LIKE A MONSTER
